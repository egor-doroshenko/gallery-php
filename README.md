# gallery-php
Web-site with registration and authorisation, profiles, photo uploads, comments and subscribes (PHP).

This is code of my pet-project. I created it to train my PHP and MySQL skills.

On this site users can create a profile, where will be shown info, avatar and all pictures, uploaded by user.
Also user with profile can to subscribe on any another profiles and watch it's publications (like in Instagram etc).
Users can leave a comments under any photo on site.

All of this functions realised with MySQLi - there is some tables (for users, pictures, comments, etc).
